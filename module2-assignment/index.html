                    I hope that you my assignment is doing well? :) I have to mention that some of requirements were not clear on github, For example, spacing is inconsistent between boxes and different responsive layouts

            <div class="col-desktop-4 col-tablet-12 col-mobile-12">

                <p id="label3">
                    Label 3

                <p class="box">
                    Github Screenshots show in desktop mode a bigger space between box 1 and 2 than between 2 and 3.
                    Mobile view margins are bigger on left side than right. I measured and replicated it best as possible. Hopefully this is correct.
