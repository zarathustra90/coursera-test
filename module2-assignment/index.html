                    I wonder... Is my solution is doing well? :).
                    I have to mention that some of the requirements were not clear on Github. 
                    For example, pictures show is inconsistent between boxes and different responsive layouts. 
                    Hopefully, we were not meant to code for these? :0

                <p id="label3">
                    Label 3
                </p>

                <p class="box">
                    Github Screenshots show in desktop mode a bigger space between boxes 1 and 2 than between 2 and 3. 
                    Mobile view margins are bigger on the left side than on the right. 
                    To be honest, I think if its its a requirement, it should be specified in bullet points.
